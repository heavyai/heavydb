Removed:

.git

Modified CMAKE to not make demo or tests

option(RDKAFKA_BUILD_EXAMPLES "Build examples" OFF)
option(RDKAFKA_BUILD_TESTS "Build tests" OFF)

CMakeLists.txt also modified to not `install()` any files. Libraries are static
linked in and license is included under `ThirdParty/licenses`.

src/CMakeLists.txt changed to link against librt if `clock_gettime` does not
exist in libc but does exist in librt (required for glibc < 2.17 on CentOS 6).
