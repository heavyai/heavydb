# -------------
#
# Find a Arrow installation.
#
# This module finds if Arrow is installed and selects a default
# configuration to use.
#
# find_package(Arrow ...)
#
#
# The following variables control which libraries are found::
#
#   Arrow_USE_STATIC_LIBS  - Set to ON to force use of static libraries.
#
# The following are set after the configuration is done:
#
# ::
#
#   Arrow_FOUND            - Set to TRUE if Arrow was found.
#   Arrow_LIBRARIES        - Path to the Arrow libraries.
#   Arrow_LIBRARY_DIRS     - compile time link directories
#   Arrow_INCLUDE_DIRS     - compile time include directories
#
#
# Sample usage:
#
# ::
#
#    find_package(Arrow)
#    if(Arrow_FOUND)
#      target_link_libraries(<YourTarget> ${Arrow_LIBRARIES})
#    endif()
