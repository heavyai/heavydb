# -------------
#
# Find a Folly installation.
#
# This module finds if Folly is installed and selects a default
# configuration to use.
#
# find_package(Folly ...)
#
#
# The following variables control which libraries are found::
#
#   Folly_USE_STATIC_LIBS  - Set to ON to force use of static libraries.
#
# The following are set after the configuration is done:
#
# ::
#
#   Folly_FOUND            - Set to TRUE if Folly was found.
#   Folly_LIBRARIES        - Path to the Folly libraries.
#   Folly_LIBRARY_DIRS     - compile time link directories
#   Folly_INCLUDE_DIRS     - compile time include directories
#
#
# Sample usage:
#
# ::
#
#    find_package(Folly)
#    if(Folly_FOUND)
#      target_link_libraries(<YourTarget> ${Folly_LIBRARIES})
#    endif()
