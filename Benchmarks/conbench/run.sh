# This is a Jenkins post-build script for running and recording benchmarks to conbench.

# Assumptions:
# * The PWD is the root git project directory.
# * The current branch is $GIT_BRANCH
# * The build directory is build-$GIT_COMMIT
# * ~/.conbench contains the credentials to the network conbench server.

# If you need to get the last 10 commits:
# git log | egrep '^commit ' | head -10 | awk '{print $2}' | tac > commits.txt
