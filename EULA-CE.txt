       9.1 Assignment. You may not delegate any of your obligations under this
       Agreement, or assign or transfer this Agreement or any of your rights
       hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior
       written consent of MapD. A change of control involving you will
       constitute an assignment for purposes of the foregoing restriction. Any
       delegation, assignment or transfer of this Agreement in violation of
       this Section 10.1 will be void and of no force and effect and a material
       breach of this Agreement. MapD may freely assign or transfer this
       Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding
       upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
       successors and assigns.

       9.2 Compliance with Laws. You will comply with all applicable laws and
       regulations relating to your Use of the Software, including without
       limitation, those relating to export and import, privacy and personal
       data protection.

       9.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the complete
       understanding between you and MapD with respect to the subject matter
       hereof and supersedes all prior understandings and communications
       relating thereto. No term or condition of a purchase order or other
       document you submit to MapD which is different from, inconsistent with,
       or in addition to the terms and conditions set forth herein will be
       binding upon MapD. To the extent that this document may constitute an
       acceptance, this acceptance is expressly conditioned on your assent to
       the terms and conditions set forth herein.

       9.4 Export Control. You may not Use or otherwise export or reexport the
       Software except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the
       jurisdiction in which the Software was obtained. In particular, but
       without limitation, the Software may not be exported or reexported (a)
       into any U.S. embargoed countries, or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury
       Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S.
       Department of Commerce Denied Person's List or Entity List. By Using the
       Software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such
       country or on any such list. You also agree that you will not Use the
       Software for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including,
       without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production
       of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.

       9.5 Force Majeure. Neither party will be responsible for any failure to
       perform its obligations under this Agreement (other than obligations to
       pay money) caused by an event beyond its reasonable control, including
       but not limited to, wars, riots, labor strikes, natural disasters, the
       infrastructure of the Internet, or any law, regulation, ordinance or
       other act or order of any court, government or governmental agency.

       9.6 Governing Law; Disputes. This Agreement will be governed by and
       construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, as
       applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within
       California between California residents. This Agreement will not be
       governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
       International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly
       excluded. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this
       Agreement, except for those relating to a breach of confidentiality by
       you, the infringement of MapD's intellectual property rights or the
       access or Use of the Software in violation of this Agreement (a
       "Claim"), will be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the
       then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
       Association ("AAA"). You and MapD will select a single, mutually
       acceptable arbitrator knowledgeable about issues relating to the subject
       matter of this Agreement. In the event that you and MapD are unable to
       agree to such a selection, AAA will appoint a single neutral arbitrator
       knowledgeable about issues relating to the subject matter of this
       Agreement to preside over the matter. The seat of arbitration will be
       San Francisco, California. The arbitration will be conducted in the
       English language, and at the option of the party seeking relief, by
       telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions. The
       arbitrator will not have the authority to modify any provision this
       Agreement or to award punitive damages. Unless the arbitrator finds the
       arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, the
       parties will split equally the costs of the arbitration. To the fullest
       extent permitted by applicable law, you and MapD each agree that any
       proceeding to resolve a Claim will be conducted only in the respective
       party's individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in
       any purported class, consolidated, multiple plaintiff or representative
       action ("Class Action"). If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court
       rather than in arbitration, such Claim will be brought only in a court
       of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco, California, both you and
       MapD agree to accept and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such
       court, and you and MapD each waive any right to a jury trial. You and
       MapD expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any
       forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not
       have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any
       Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to
       the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action waiver
       is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined
       only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In
       no event will any Claim, or any other action or proceeding by you
       (including arbitration under this Section 10.7) be instituted more than
       1 year after the cause of action arose. Any judgment on the award
       rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
       jurisdiction. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing
       arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you and MapD each agree
       to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in
       San Francisco, California, and you and MapD each agree to submit to the
       exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of
       litigating any applicable Claim.

       9.7 Government End Users. The Software and Documentation are "Commercial
       Items", as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of
       "Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software
       Documentation", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 or 48 C.F.R.
       227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 or 48 C.F.R.
       227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer
       Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being
       licensed to U.S. Government end users and U.S. Government contractors
       (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are
       granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions
       herein.

       9.8 Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may not be modified or amended
       except pursuant to a written instrument signed by both parties. The
       waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof will not be
       construed as a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or any other
       provision, nor will any delay or omission on the part of such party to
       avail itself of any right, power or privilege that it has or may have
       hereunder operate as a waiver of any right, power or privilege.

       9.9 Publicity. MapD may include your name and logo on its customer lists
       and reference the fact that you are a customer of MapD. However, neither
       party may issue a press release regarding this Agreement without the
       other party's prior written approval (which will not be unreasonably
       withheld or delayed).

       9.10 Notices. Notices in connection with this Agreement must be in
       writing and either delivered in person or by recognized commercial
       courier or certified mail, postage and fees prepaid, return receipt
       requested, and addressed (a) if to MapD, to MapD Technologies, Inc., 1
       Front Street, Suite 2650, San Francisco, CA, 94111 USA, Attention: Legal
       Department, and (b) if to you, to the address you provided to MapD prior
       to downloading the Software, or to such other address as you have
       specified by notice hereunder. Notices will be deemed effective when
       received or, if delivery is refused, when delivery is attempted.

       9.11 Relationship of Parties. MapD and you are independent contractors,
       and neither party, nor any of their respective affiliates, is an agent
       of the other for any purpose or has the authority to bind the other.

       9.12 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is
       for any reason held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by
       a court of competent jurisdiction, to such extent such provision will be
       deemed null and void and severed from this Agreement, and the remainder
       hereof will remain in full force and effect.
