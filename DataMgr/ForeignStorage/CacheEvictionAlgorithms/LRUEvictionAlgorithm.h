/**
 * @file LRUEvictionAlgorithm.h
 * @brief
 *
 * This file includes the class specification for the Least Recently Used cache eviction
 * algorithm used by the Foreign Storage Interface (FSI).
 *
 * // TODO(Misiu): A lot of the code here is replicated from StringDictionary/LruCache.hpp
 * with some minor extensions for deletion and changed to use a set.  It should be merged.
 *
 * This algorithm tracks which chunks were the least recently used by relying on the
 * touch_chunk function being called when they are used.  It tracks the order of use
 * in a simple queue.
