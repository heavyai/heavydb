/**
 * @file CacheEvictionAlgorithm.h
 * @brief
 *
 * This file includes the class specification for the cache eviction algorithm interface
 * used by the Foreign Storage Interface (FSI).  This interface can be implemented to
 * quickly slot out different caching algorithms for the FSI cache.
 * A caching algorithm can be queried to determine which chunks should be evicted in what
 * order and needs to be updated with cache usage data.
