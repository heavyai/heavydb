# Building

If this is your first time building MapD Core, install the dependencies mentioned in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section below.

MapD uses CMake for its build system.

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug ..
    make -j 4

The following `cmake`/`ccmake` options can enable/disable different features:

- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release` - Build type and compiler options to use.
                                 Options are `Debug`, `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo`, `MinSizeRel`, and unset.
- `-DENABLE_ASAN=off` - Enable address sanitizer. Default is `off`.
- `-DENABLE_AWS_S3=on` - Enable AWS S3 support, if available. Default is `on`.
- `-DENABLE_CALCITE_DELETE_PATH=on` - Enable Calcite Delete Path. Default is `on`.
- `-DENABLE_CALCITE_UPDATE_PATH=on` - Enable Calcite Update Path. Default is `on`.

- `-DPREFER_STATIC_LIBS=off` - Static link dependencies, if available. Default is `off`.

# Testing

MapD Core uses [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) as its main testing framework. Tests reside under the [Tests](Tests) directory.

The `sanity_tests` target runs the most common tests. If using Makefiles to build, the tests may be run using:

    make sanity_tests

## AddressSanitizer

[AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) can be activated by setting the `ENABLE_ASAN` CMake flag in a fresh build directory. At this time CUDA must also be disabled. In an empty build directory run CMake and compile:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DENABLE_ASAN=on -DENABLE_CUDA=off ..
    make -j 4

Finally run the tests:

    export ASAN_OPTIONS=alloc_dealloc_mismatch=0:handle_segv=0
    make sanity_tests

## ThreadSanitizer

[ThreadSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerCppManual) can be activated by setting the `ENABLE_TSAN` CMake flag in a fresh build directory. At this time CUDA must also be disabled. In an empty build directory run CMake and compile:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DENABLE_TSAN=on -DENABLE_CUDA=off ..
    make -j 4

We use a TSAN suppressions file to ignore warnings in third party libraries. Source the suppressions file by adding it to your `TSAN_OPTIONS` env:

    export TSAN_OPTIONS="suppressions=/path/to/mapd/config/tsan.suppressions"

Finally run the tests:

    make sanity_tests

# Generating Packages

MapD Core uses [CPack](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cpack.1.html) to generate packages for distribution. Packages generated on CentOS with static linking enabled can be used on most other recent Linux distributions.

To generate packages on CentOS (assuming starting from top level of the mapd-core repository):

    mkdir build-package && cd build-package
    cmake -DPREFER_STATIC_LIBS=on -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ..
    make -j 4
    cpack -G TGZ

The first command creates a fresh build directory, to ensure there is nothing left over from a previous build.

The second command configures the build to prefer linking to the dependencies' static libraries instead of the (default) shared libraries, and to build using CMake's `release` configuration (enables compiler optimizations). Linking to the static versions of the libraries libraries reduces the number of dependencies that must be installed on target systems.

The last command generates a `.tar.gz` package. The `TGZ` can be replaced with, for example, `RPM` or `DEB` to generate a `.rpm` or `.deb`, respectively.

# Using

The [`startmapd`](startmapd) wrapper script may be used to start MapD Core in a testing environment. This script performs the following tasks:

- initializes the `data` storage directory via `initdb`, if required
- starts the main MapD Core server, `mapd_server`
- starts the MapD Core web server, `mapd_web_server`, for serving MapD Immerse
- offers to download and import a sample dataset, using the `insert_sample_data` script
- attempts to open MapD Immerse in your web browser

Assuming you are in the `build` directory, and it is a subdirectory of the `mapd-core` repository, `startmapd` may be run by:

    ../startmapd

## Starting Manually

It is assumed that the following commands are run from inside the `build` directory.

Initialize the `data` storage directory. This command only needs to be run once.

    mkdir data && ./bin/initdb data

Start the MapD Core server:

    ./bin/mapd_server

In a new terminal, start the MapD Core web server:

    ./bin/mapd_web_server

If desired, insert a sample dataset by running the `insert_sample_data` script in a new terminal:

    ../insert_sample_data

You can now start using the database. The `mapdql` utility may be used to interact with the database from the command line:

    ./bin/mapdql -p HyperInteractive

where `HyperInteractive` is the default password. The default user `mapd` is assumed if not provided.

You can also interact with the database using the web-based MapD Immerse frontend by visiting the web server's default port of `9092`:

[http://localhost:9092](http://localhost:9092)

Note: usage of MapD Immerse is governed by a separate license agreement, provided under `EULA-CE.txt`. The version bundled with this project may only be used for non-commercial purposes.

# Code Style

A [`.clang-format`](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) style configuration, based on the Chromium style guide, is provided at the top level of the repository. Please format your code using a recent version (6.0+ preferred) of ClangFormat before submitting.

To use:

    clang-format -i File.cpp

Contributed code should compile without generating warnings by recent compilers on most Linux distributions. Changes to the code should follow the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).

Dependencies for `mapd_web_server` and other Go utils are in [`ThirdParty/go`](ThirdParty/go). See [`ThirdParty/go/src/mapd/vendor/README.md`](ThirdParty/go/src/mapd/vendor/README.md) for instructions on how to add new deps.

## CentOS 7

MapD Core requires a number of dependencies which are not provided in the common CentOS/RHEL package repositories. The script [scripts/mapd-deps-centos.sh](scripts/mapd-deps-centos.sh) is provided to automatically build and install these dependencies. A prebuilt package containing these dependencies is also provided for CentOS 7 (x86_64).

First install the basic build tools:

    sudo yum groupinstall -y "Development Tools"
    sudo yum install -y \
        zlib-devel \
        epel-release \
        libssh \
        openssl-devel \
        ncurses-devel \
        git \
        maven \
        java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel \
        java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless \
        gperftools \
        gperftools-devel \
        gperftools-libs \
        python-devel \
        wget \
        curl \
        environment-modules

Next download and install the prebuilt dependencies:

    curl -OJ https://dependencies.mapd.com/mapd-deps/deploy.sh
    sudo bash deploy.sh

These dependencies will be installed to a directory under `/usr/local/mapd-deps`. The `deploy.sh` script also installs [Environment Modules](http://modules.sf.net) in order to simplify managing the required environment variables. Log out and log back in after running the `deploy.sh` script in order to active Environment Modules command, `module`.

The `mapd-deps` environment module is disabled by default. To activate for your current session, run:

    module load mapd-deps

To disable the `mapd-deps` module:

    module unload mapd-deps

WARNING: The `mapd-deps` package contains newer versions of packages such as GCC and ncurses which might not be compatible with the rest of your environment. Make sure to disable the `mapd-deps` module before compiling other packages.

Instructions for installing CUDA are below.

### CUDA

It is preferred, but not necessary, to install CUDA and the NVIDIA drivers using the .rpm using the [instructions provided by NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). The `rpm (network)` method (preferred) will ensure you always have the latest stable drivers, while the `rpm (local)` method allows you to install does not require Internet access.

The .rpm method requires DKMS to be installed, which is available from the [Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) repository:

    sudo yum install epel-release

Be sure to reboot after installing in order to activate the NVIDIA drivers.

### Environment Variables

[scripts/mapd-deps-centos.sh](scripts/mapd-deps-centos.sh) generates two files with the appropriate environment variables: `mapd-deps-<date>.sh` (for sourcing from your shell config) and `mapd-deps-<date>.modulefile` (for use with [Environment Modules](http://modules.sf.net), yum package `environment-modules`). These files are placed in mapd-deps install directory, usually `/usr/local/mapd-deps/<date>`. Either of these may be used to configure your environment: the `.sh` may be sourced in your shell config; the `.modulefile` needs to be moved to the modulespath.

## macOS

[scripts/mapd-deps-osx.sh](scripts/mapd-deps-osx.sh) is provided that will automatically install and/or update [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and use that to install all dependencies. Please make sure macOS is completely update to date and Xcode is installed before running. Xcode can be installed from the App Store.

### CUDA

`mapd-deps-osx.sh` will automatically install CUDA via Homebrew and add the correct environment variables to `~/.bash_profile`.

### Java

`mapd-deps-osx.sh` will automatically install Java and Maven via Homebrew and add the correct environment variables to `~/.bash_profile`.

## Ubuntu

Most build dependencies required by MapD Core are available via APT. Certain dependencies such as Thrift, Blosc, and Folly must be built as they either do not exist in the default repositories or have outdated versions. The provided build script will install all required dependencies (except CUDA) and build the dependencies which require it. The built dependencies will be installed to `/usr/local/mapd-deps/` by default; see the Environment Variables section below for how to add these dependencies to your environment.

### Ubuntu 16.04

MapD Core requires a newer version of Boost than the version which is provided by Ubuntu 16.04. The [scripts/mapd-deps-ubuntu1604.sh](scripts/mapd-deps-ubuntu1604.sh) build script will compile and install a newer version of Boost into the `/usr/local/mapd-deps/` directory. 

### Ubuntu 18.04

Use the [scripts/mapd-deps-ubuntu.sh](scripts/mapd-deps-ubuntu.sh) build script to install dependencies. 

Some installs of Ubuntu 18.04 may fail while building with a message similar to:

    java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty

This is a known issue in 18.04 which will be resolved in [Ubuntu 18.04.1](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ca-certificates-java/+bug/1739631). To resolve on 18.04:

    sudo rm /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts
    sudo update-ca-certificates -f

### Environment Variables

The CUDA and mapd-deps `lib` directories need to be added to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`; the CUDA and mapd-deps `bin` directories need to be added to `PATH`. The `mapd-deps-ubuntu.sh` script above will generate a script named `mapd-deps.sh` containing the environment variables which need to be set. Simply source this file in your current session (or symlink it to `/etc/profile.d/mapd-deps.sh`) in order to activate it:

    source /usr/local/mapd-deps/mapd-deps.sh

### CUDA

Recent versions of Ubuntu provide the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit and drivers in the standard repositories. To install:

    sudo apt install -y \
        nvidia-cuda-toolkit

Be sure to reboot after installing in order to activate the NVIDIA drivers.

## Arch

The following uses [yaourt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Yaourt) to install packages from the [Arch User Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository).

    yaourt -S \
        git \
        cmake \
        boost \
        google-glog \
        extra/jdk8-openjdk \
        clang \
        llvm \
        thrift \
        go \
        gdal \
        maven

    VERS=1.21-45
    wget --continue https://github.com/jarro2783/bisonpp/archive/$VERS.tar.gz
    tar xvf $VERS.tar.gz
    pushd bisonpp-$VERS
    ./configure
    make -j $(nproc)
    sudo make install
    popd

### CUDA

CUDA and the NVIDIA drivers may be installed using the following.

    yaourt -S \
        linux-headers \
        cuda \
        nvidia

Be sure to reboot after installing in order to activate the NVIDIA drivers.

### Environment Variables

The CUDA `bin` directories need to be added to `PATH`. The easiest way to do so is by creating a new file named `/etc/profile.d/mapd-deps.sh` containing the following:

    PATH=/opt/cuda/bin:$PATH
    export PATH
