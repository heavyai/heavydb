OmniSciDB (formerly MapD Core)
==============================

OmniSciDB is an open source SQL-based, relational, columnar database engine that leverages the full performance and parallelism of modern hardware (both CPUs and GPUs) to enable querying of multi-billion row datasets in milliseconds, without the need for indexing, pre-aggregation, or downsampling.  OmniSciDB can be run on hybrid CPU/GPU systems (Nvidia GPUs are currently supported), as well as on CPU-only systems featuring X86, Power, and ARM (experimental support) architectures. To achieve maximum performance, OmniSciDB features multi-tiered caching of data between storage, CPU memory, and GPU memory, and an innovative Just-In-Time (JIT) query compilation framework.
