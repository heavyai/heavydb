OmniSciDB (formerly MapD Core)
==============================

OmniSciDB is an open source SQL-based, relational, columnar database engine. This project is specifically developed to harness the parallel processing power of graphics processing units (GPUs). OmniSciDB can query up to billions of rows in milliseconds, and benefits from the advantages that GPUs provide, such as parallelism or the ability to process in parallel, which can boost performance. OmniSciDB also uses multi-tiered memory caching, a Just-In-Time (JIT) query compilation framework and in-situ graphics rendering.
