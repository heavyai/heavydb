OmniSciDB is being intensively developed and is evolving quickly. In order to help the MapD developer community understand our near term priorities, this document shares work targeted for the next 3-6 months. Many of these items are the result of community requests.

We welcome and encourage developer contributions to the project. Please see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/mapd/mapd-core#contributing) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mapd/mapd-core/issues).
