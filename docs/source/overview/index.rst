System Overview

OmniSciDB is made up of several high level components. A diagram illustrating most of the components of the system is displayed below, with a short description of each major section of the documentation following.

Data Model
===========

The :doc:`../data_model/index` section provides an overview of the data formats and data types supported by OmniSciDB. A brief overview of various storage layer components is also included.

Data Flow
=========

The :doc:`../flow/data` section ties together the :doc:`../data_model/index` and :doc:`../execution/index` sections, providing information about the complete flow of data from the input columns for a query to its projected outputs.

Query Execution
==========================
The :doc:`../execution/index` section provides an overview
of how a query is executed inside OmniSciDB.

At a high-level, all SQL queries made to the server pass through the
Thrift_ `sql_execute` endpoint. The query string is passed to Apache Calcite_ 
for parsing and cost-based optimization, yielding an optimized relational 
algebra tree. This relational algebra tree is then passed through OmniSci-specific 
optimization passes and translated into an OmniSCi-specific abstract syntax tree (AST). 
The AST provides all the information necessary to generate native machine code for 
query execution on the target device. Execution then occurs in parallel on the target 
device, with device results being aggregated and reduced into a final `ResultSet`
for each query step.

The sections following provide in-depth details on each of the
stages involved in executing a query.
