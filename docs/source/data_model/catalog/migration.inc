OmniSciDB includes a schema migration service for migrating user catalog information between versions. The schema migration service can also drive storage level migrations. The ``mapd_version_history`` table enables tracking whether or not a migration has been performed. When changing `SysCatalog` or `Catalog` *SQLite* schema, migrations must be used to ensure previous data directories work properly.
