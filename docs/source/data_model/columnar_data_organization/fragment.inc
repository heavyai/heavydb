A fragment describes a horizontal partition of a set of rows in a table.  A set of fragments makes up a table (see Diagram below). By default, each fragment will consist of 32 million records. Fragment size is configurable when the table is created (see `CREATE TABLE <https://docs.heavy.ai/latest/5_tables.html#create-table-1>`_).
