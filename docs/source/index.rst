==================================
OmniSciDB at 30,000 feet
==================================

OmniSciDB is an open source SQL-based, relational, columnar database engine
that leverages the full performance and parallelism of modern hardware
(both CPUs and GPUs) to enable querying of multi-billion row datasets
in milliseconds, without the need for indexing, pre-aggregation, or
downsampling.

OmniSciDB can be run on hybrid CPU/GPU systems, as well as on CPU-only systems
featuring X86, Power, and ARM (experimental support) architectures. To achieve
maximum performance, OmniSciDB features multi-tiered caching of data between
storage, CPU memory, and GPU memory, as well as an innovative Just-In-Time
(JIT) query compilation framework built around LLVM.

This developer documentation provides an in-depth discussion of the OmniSciDB
internals, and details the data model and query execution flows.
