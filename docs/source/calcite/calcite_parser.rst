.. OmniSciDB Query Execution

==============
Calcite Parser
==============

OmniSciDB offloads query string parsing and cost-based optimization of the input SQL query to `Apache Calcite <https://calcite.apache.org/>`_. Calcite generates `extended relational algebra <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra#Common_extensions>`_ from SQL queries, returning a relational algebra tree serialized inside a JSON string. 

One of the main strengths of Calcite is its highly modular structure, which allows for multiple integration points and creative uses. It offers a relational algebra builder, which makes moving to a different SQL parser (or adding a non-SQL frontend) feasible. In OmniSciDB, additional runtime functions which are not recognized by Calcite by default are necessary. For example, trigonometric functions are required for on-the-fly geospatial projections. Fortunately, Calcite allows specifying such functions and they become first-class citizens, with proper type checking in place. 

Calcite also includes a highly capable and flexible cost-based optimizer, which can apply high-level transformations to the relational algebra based on query patterns and statistics. For example, it can push part of a filter through a join in order to reduce the size of the input, like the following figure shows:

More information about Calcite's cost-based optimizer is available `in this presentation <http://www.slideshare.net/HadoopSummit/costbased-query-optimization-64039776>`_ on using it in the Apache Phoenix project. Such optimizations complement the low-level optimizations in OmniSciDB (e.g. operator fusion) to achieve great speed improvements.

Let's take a simple query: 

.. code-block:: sql 

  SELECT A.x, COUNT(*) FROM test JOIN B ON A.x = B.x WHERE A.y > 41 GROUP BY A.x; 
  
and analyze the relational algebra generated for it.

In Calcite relational algebra, there are a few main node types, corresponding to the theoretical extended relational algebra model: `Scan`, `Filter`, `Project`, `Aggregate` and `Join`. Each type of node, except `Scan`, has one or more (in the case of `Join`) inputs and its output can become the input of another node. The graph of nodes connected by data flow relationships is a **directed acyclic graph** (abbreviated as "DAG"). For our query, Calcite outputs the following DAG:

  :align: center

The `Scan` nodes have no inputs and output all the rows and the columns in tables `A` and `B`, respectively. The `Join` node specifies the join condition (in our case ``A.x = B.x``) and its output contains the columns in `A` and `B` concatenated. The `Filter` node only allows the rows which pass the specified condition and its output preserves all columns of input. The `Project` node only preserves the specified expressions as columns in the output. Finally, the `Aggregate` specifies the group by expressions and aggregates.

The physical implementation of the nodes is up to the system using Calcite as a frontend. Nothing in the `Join` node mandates a certain implementation of the join operation (equijoin in OmniSciDB). Indeed, using a condition which can't be implemented as a hash join, like `A.x < B.x`, would only be reflected by the condition in the `Filter` node.
