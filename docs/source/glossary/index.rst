    target
        An expression whose value is returned to the user as part of a projection. 

    fragment
        A row-wise striping across all columns in a table in a fixed unit (32,000,000 rows by default). See :doc:`../data_model/columnar_layout` for more information. 
    
    chunk
        The intersection of a :term:`fragment` and a column. A single chunk is a series of rows from one column in a table and is uniquely identified by the `chunk key`, a tuple consisting of database ID, table ID, column ID, and fragment ID.
